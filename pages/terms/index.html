                        of correction request on the update you placed, until you are satisfied as far as the corrections do not generate new update requests. If it does, it will be considered as a new update and will be deducted from your update count.

                        <br> If we do not receive a reply for our email in 48 hours after completion of your update, Your update count automatically lapses and we will execute it without any prior approval from you. The timeframe will be set by the developer
                        in charge of your project as the time frame depends from case to case. The minimum time frame to respond to an update request is 48 hours and it can go up to 96 hours maximum depending on the complexity and the workload we have
                        on hand.

                        and this Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters covered hereby. In case of a conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order, service order, work order, confirmation,
                        correspondence or other communication of User or www.oxtec.net, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. No additional terms or conditions relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be effective unless
                        approved in writing by any authorized representative of User and www.oxtec.net. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by another agreement in writing executed by the parties hereto; provided, however, that these
                        Terms of Service may be modified from time to time by www.oxtec.net in its sole discretion, which modifications will be effective upon posting to www.oxtec.net's Web site.

                        <br> * Severability. All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to
                        the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court
                        of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions

                        <br>
                        <br> * Waiver. No failure or delay by any party hereto to exercise any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy by any party preclude any other
                        or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. No express waiver or assent by any party hereto to any breach of or default in any term or condition of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of or an
                        assent to any succeeding breach of or default in the same or any other term or condition hereof.<br>
                        <br> * Assignment; Successors. User may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of www.oxtec.net. Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing
                        provision shall be null and void and of no force or effect whatsoever. www.oxtec.net may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and may engage subcontractors or agents in performing its duties and exercising its
                        rights hereunder, without the consent of User. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.<br>
                        <br> * Limitation of Actions. No action, regardless of form, arising by reason of or in connection with this Agreement may be brought by either party more than two years after the cause of action has arisen.
                        <br>
                        <br> * Counterparts. If this Agreement is signed manually, it may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. If this
                        Agreement is signed electronically, www.oxtec.net's records of such execution shall be presumed accurate unless proven otherwise.<br>
                        <br> * Force Majeure. Neither party is liable for any default or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than failure to make payments when due) if such default or delay is caused, directly
                        or indirectly, by forces beyond such party's reasonable control, including, without limitation, fire, flood, acts of God, labor disputes, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, interruptions of transportation or communications, supply
                        shortages or the failure of any third party to perform any commitment relative to the production or delivery of any equipment or material required for such party to perform its obligations hereunder.
                        <br>
                        <br> * No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed to confer any rights, Terms of Service or equitable, in
                        any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, User acknowledges and agrees that any supplier of third-party product or service that is identified
                        as a third-party beneficiary in the Service Description, is an intended third-party beneficiary of the provisions set forth in this Agreement as they relate specifically to its products or services and shall have the right to enforce
